# EmailContact

The Email Contact List Management system efficiently manages the mail contact list. 
A new contact can be added to the contact list at anytime. 
It helps to assign contacts to the categories dynamically or manually. It helps to group the contacts 
and manage unsubscribers so that the messages are sent to the right people. A user can unsubscribe from a 
category if he is not interested. Once a user unsubscribes no further messages from that category will be sent to that user.
